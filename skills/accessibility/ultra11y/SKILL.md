# ultra11y — audit WCAG 2.2 AA and write accessible markup

On accessibility, an automated tool only sees part of the problem. `ultra11y` owns
that with a **division of labour**: the deterministic, install-free engine
(`node scripts/ultra11y.mjs <command>` — no `npm install`, no key; the JSX/TSX parser
is embedded in the bundle) does the *mechanical* work — detect the machine-checkable
non-conformities and tie each to the right **WCAG success criterion** — and **the active coding
agent** *adjudicates the judgment criteria itself* — alt relevance, link
purpose in context, reading order — statically, from the evidence the engine harvests
(`verify --manual`), each verdict gated by `verify`/`check`. Only the truly **rendered-DOM**
criteria (computed contrast, visible focus, zoom/reflow, content-on-hover) fall to the `scan`
tier (axe-core in a real browser); a human is at most optional oversight. Gates stop any
hallucinated non-conformity from surviving, and nothing is ever silently "conforming".

**Do not confuse rules with criteria.** The bundle ships 93 static checks, WCAG AA has 55
success criteria, and RGAA has 106 criteria. Several rules may evidence one criterion, one
rule may contribute to several pack criteria, and most criteria remain open until a scan or
an adjudication. The only honest run-level coverage is the grid's live provenance tally
(`moteur + scan + agent`, plus any named undecidable residue), never a fixed promise such as
“48 agent criteria”. GitHub summaries therefore show `decided/total`, not a percentage over
the small decided subset.

**WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the worldwide core.** Country standards — France's **RGAA**, the
US **Section 508**, the EU **EN 301 549** — are pluggable *standards packs* that map their
criteria onto WCAG. Add `--standard rgaa` to re-key **every command and every output** —
`audit` included, findings and all; **plug an external
pack at runtime** with `--pack ./pack.json` (or a `.ultra11yrc.json`), no rebuild; or
contribute your country (see `references/standards.md`). Packs (and their concrete
**implementation guidance** — the RGAA SocialGouv/etalab good/bad patterns) can be
**AI-ingested** and gated by `pack check` so a fabricated mapping never passes — see
`references/packs.md` and `references/guidance.md`.

**Most of the work is yours.** Of the 55 WCAG 2.2 AA success criteria, the engine can decide
**3** outright; **14** need a rendered page (`scan`) and **38** are judgment calls the agent
adjudicates. So the engine's clean run is a starting point, never a verdict — and
`references/adjudication.md` is the page you actually work from.

> **Core rules:**
> 1. **Never invent a non-conformity**: every `NC` cites a real, resolvable element (`check` verifies it).
> 2. **Native HTML first, ARIA last**; never duplicate implicit semantics.
> 3. **Never invent a conformity either**: a `C` is cited exactly like an `NC` — it names in
>    `citations[]` the harvested evidence it cleared, each anchor resolvable and drawn from
>    the evidence that criterion was actually shown. A criterion presented with *no* evidence
>    cannot be `C` at all; it stays `manual`. Neither can one whose reading was INCOMPLETE
>    (`evidenceComplete: false`): a criterion you were shown part of can still fail on what
>    you saw, but it can never be cleared over what you did not. And an adjudicated `C` is
>    never merged with an engine-decided one: reports list it separately and keep it out of
>    the automatic pass rate.
> 3b. **What you are shown is the whole population, said once per distinct thing.** Evidence
>    is one representative per CONTENT CLASS, carrying `occurrences`, the other anchors in
>    `alsoAt`, and the `pages` it appears on — 887 links across 38 captured pages are 97
>    distinct (text, href) pairs. Ruling on the representative rules on all of them, which is
>    what makes an honest `C` reachable; and a citation naming ANY occurrence of a class the
>    criterion carries is accepted, so cite the one you actually opened.
> 4. **Residual is explicit, never silently conforming**: the AI agent *adjudicates* every
>    *judgment* criterion itself (`verify --manual`, gated), and the *rendering* criteria go to
>    `scan` — which now CONCLUDES `C` (`decidedBy: "scan"`) when every rule carrying a
>    criterion ran on every page in scope and raised nothing, and stays silent when even one
>    page's signals were incomplete. Any criterion still unproven stays "to assess manually" —
>    no status without a recorded, justified verdict. To make that a gate rather than a hope,
>    `check --in <audit.json> --require-decided` fails while anything is still to assess, and
>    `--allow-undecided <file>` takes the criteria you genuinely cannot decide, each with its
>    reason (a named list, never a threshold). `--require-decided=pages` holds EVERY page's own
>    grid to the same bar: a criterion failing on one route is settled for the run and may still
>    be nobody's verdict on the routes it never fired on, which is what a per-page deliverable is
>    actually judged on.
> 5. **Look the criterion up; never recall it.** `criteria [--standard <pack>] <id>` — or
>    `ultra11y_criteria` over MCP — returns the criterion's own wording, its **numbered
>    tests**, and the glossary definitions those tests cite. RGAA 8.3 is not "the page needs a
>    `lang` attribute"; it is test `8.3.1` with two alternative conditions, and the glossary
>    decides what its terms mean. An auditor block that cites `8.3.1` after reading it is
>    grounded; one that cites it from memory is a guess wearing a reference. Before auditing
>    against a country standard, run the plan (`ultra11y_method`): it tells you how many of its
>    criteria that still need adjudication to earn C — for RGAA, **103 of 106**. See `references/mcp.md`.
> 6. **The FINAL rendered semantic HTML must be correct.** The engine sees only source; a
>    component library (DSFR/MUI…) or `.vue`/`.svelte`/`.astro` SFC hides the real markup, so
>    a green source audit is not proof. Verify the produced semantic HTML — install the
>    zero-touch **capture** harvester (`render --setup`) so every component your tests render
>    is serialized to `.ultra11y/captures` and audited, with `audit --require-captures` gating
>    the blind spots. See `references/automation.md` / `rendered.md`.
> 7. **Language**: ALWAYS pass `--lang` matching the language of your conversation with
>    the user; ask the user when ambiguous. Without the flag the CLI auto-detects (repo
>    `<html lang>` → the active standard's default locale → English) — a scripted/CI
>    fallback, not a substitute for passing `--lang` yourself.
> 8. **Technical tokens stay in English, even in French prose.** In any French deliverable
>    you write (report commentary, PRD, tracker tickets, judgment verdicts), attribute/
>    element/role names and their values are code, not prose — never translate them:
>    `aria-live` stays `aria-live` (never « région live »), same for `tabindex`, `alt`,
>    `role="alert"`, landmark role names. The engine's own fr catalog follows this; match
>    it. Normative standard vocabulary (RGAA wording such as « lien d'évitement ») keeps
>    its official French.

## Choose by situation

- **"Produce a detailed audit/report in Claude Code"** → use the active Claude session as the
  auditor, close the rendered and judgment criteria, challenge its claims, then publish the
  dated Markdown report, printable HTML and evidenced per-page dossiers. Read
  **`references/claude-code-report.md`**. This is the interactive publication profile; finish
  with its full deliverable set. The compact summary is the CI branch below.
- **"Audit / compliance report"** → `node scripts/ultra11y.mjs audit … --json`, then
  `report` (synthesis table + one **auditor conformance block** per NC criterion — same
  block `prd` and `tickets` use), then `check`; read **`references/audit.md`**.
- **"Code rendered by a library (DSFR, MUI…) or a `.vue`/`.svelte`/`.astro` SFC / avoid
  false negatives"** → audit the **produced HTML**, not the source template. Easiest:
  install the zero-touch **capture** harvester (`render --setup`) so your tests serialize
  every rendered component to `.ultra11y/captures` (auto-ingested, findings attributed to the
  source component; `render --coverage` and `audit --require-captures` track blind spots). Or
  `render` (build→audit recipe or SSR snapshot `--scaffold`) then `audit` on the output, and
  `scan` for computed rendering. SFC-source findings are flagged `preliminary` (a
  `scope.sourceTemplate` caveat); read **`references/rendered.md`**.
- **"A finding looks wrong / false positive on a component"** → the engine auto-suppresses
  most component false positives (slot/prop-injected names, component children, dynamic
  bindings, conditional headings) and marks SFC/library-source findings `preliminary`;
  confirm or refute the rest with `verify --apply`; read **`references/false-positives.md`**.
- **"Large repo / audit smartly"** → focus: `--changed` (git diff), template
  prioritization, dedup, `--max-files`; read **`references/scale.md`**.
- **"Cross-file analysis (tree + dependencies), JSX/TSX as a real AST"** →
  `audit --graph` resolves imports and applies cross-file rules (an icon-only component
  used without a name, an anchor target in another file…), no browser; read
  **`references/cross-file.md`**.
- **"Generate the fix markdown / PRDs"** → `prd` (the SAME auditor
  conformance block `report`'s NC section renders — theme/criterion/test/WCAG+level/
  finding/expected/verification in the active standard's vocabulary — as a backlog);
  `--split criterion`, `--format doc` for a product-requirements doc, `--format remediation`
  for the legacy dev backlog). It writes markdown only; read
  **`references/prd.md`**.
- **"Open tickets / issues for this (GitHub · GitLab · Jira)"** → `tickets`, a separate
  command that reads the audit and files it, writing no markdown. `--grain` picks what one
  ticket is: per criterion (default), per page, per page+criterion, per file, or one
  consolidated. De-dupe is by exact title, so re-running never duplicates. Always
  `--dry-run` first; read **`references/tickets.md`**.
- **"Plug or author a standards pack (RGAA & beyond), AI-ingest external rules"** →
  `--pack`/`.ultra11yrc.json` to load at runtime, `pack check` to gate it (the
  anti-hallucination guardrail), `pack scaffold` to start one; concrete before/after
  implementation guidance attaches to findings/PRD; read **`references/packs.md`** and
  **`references/guidance.md`**.
- **"Adjudicate the judgment criteria (judgment phase)"** → `verify --manual --in audit.json`
  emits an ADJUDICATION worklist (`ADJUDICATE.todo.json` + `ADJUDICATE.md`), one item per
  residual criterion, pre-loaded with the engine's harvested evidence (every alt, link text +
  context, literal colour pairs, control labels, heading outline, ARIA state, tabindex,
  lang-of-parts); the AI agent fills each `verdict` — `C`/`NA` (with a `justification`), `NC`
  (with a groundable finding), or `manual` (with a `reason`) — then `verify --apply … --in
  audit.json` folds them back FAIL-CLOSED; read **`references/judgment.md`**.
- **"Many items to adjudicate/verify (fan the judgment out to subagents)"** →
  `orchestrate --run <dir>` emits, from the run's CURRENT worklists, one launchable
  multi-agent workflow per ready phase + the `agents/<role>.md` dispatch contracts +
  a sequential `RUNBOOK.md` — the default execution path on a subagent-capable harness;
  see **Orchestration — route by harness** below.
- **"Focus, keyboard & interaction logic (the interaction-logic part)"** → the engine marks
  focus order/visible/trap and on-focus/on-input criteria as residual risks; the AI agent reads
  the full component source and adjudicates the keyboard/focus behaviour (visible-focus and the
  other rendered criteria go to `scan`); read **`references/focus-and-logic.md`**.
- **"Put the fixes in place"** → `fix` (dry-run by default, `--write` applies the safe
  codemods, proposes the rest without inventing anything); read **`references/fix.md`**.
- **"Fix by priority, no regressions (correction phase)"** → `fix` (`--write`,
  `--iterate`) + the `prd` backlog, blocking→major→minor; read **`references/correction.md`**.
- **"Automatic repo gate (hook / CI)"** → `init --hook` writes a git pre-commit gate over
  the **strict staged snapshot** (audits the exact index blobs, auto-applies safe fixes and
  re-stages them, blocks only on judgment issues); `init --baseline`/`--ci` is the opt-in
  "block only NEW non-conformities" variant. Installed as a **Claude Code plugin**, a third
  gate runs the `review-a11y` *skill* (not just the engine) on a pending commit/push/PR —
  that one is shipped by the plugin, not by `init`. For library/SFC code, commit rendered
  **captures** (`render --setup`) and stage them so the real semantic HTML is what's
  checked (`audit --require-captures`); read **`references/automation.md`**.
- **"Show me the problems while I build the page"** → `dev --next` writes a one-line overlay
  component and `dev` starts a loopback side-car: a floating panel lists the current page's
  non-conformities, each opening its `file:line` in your editor, and `http://127.0.0.1:4111`
  accumulates the per-page grid as you browse. Renders nothing outside development; read
  **`references/devtools.md`**.
- **"Check a page during our E2E tests"** → `render --e2e` writes Playwright/Cypress fixtures
  that audit the page **as your test left it** (logged in, form filled, modal open) — state a
  separate `scan` run does not have — and persist each checked page as a snapshot. `failOn`
  gates the test; `failOn: false` records without failing, which is how you adopt it on an
  existing backlog; read **`references/e2e.md`**.
- **"Audit the real PAGE, not the component"** → a **page snapshot**
  (`.ultra11y/pages/<id>/`) is the whole rendered document plus the browser-only signals
  (computed styles, boxes, a11y tree, screenshot), ingested by `audit` automatically. Because
  it is a FULL document, the page-scoped rules run on it — that is where RGAA 8.3 (lang),
  8.5/8.6 (title) and 12.6 become decidable at all; read **`references/pages.md`**.
- **"Decide the rendering criteria without a browser in CI"** → once a page snapshot exists,
  the **rendered tier** runs inside the ordinary `audit`: computed-style contrast
  (RGAA 3.2/10.5), screenshot-measured contrast for text over a gradient/image (the CSSOM
  blind spot axe-core shares), and colour-only link identification (**RGAA 10.6**, previously
  undecidable). Each leaves the criterion `manual` when it cannot measure — never a guess;
  read **`references/pages.md`**.
- **"Give me the RGAA grid, page by page"** → `pages --in audits/audit-latest.json --standard
  rgaa` (also embedded in `report`): one row per criterion, one column per page **URL**, rebuilt from
  the committed audit.json alone. Two rules hold: a finding is attributed to a page only when
  something SAYS so (else it is reported as unattributed, never spread), and `C` by silence is
  earned only by a page whose real DOM was audited — a source-only page keeps its undecided
  criteria « à évaluer »; read **`references/pages.md`**.
- **"I want a report PER PAGE, not a matrix"** → `pages --in audits/audit-latest.json
  --standard rgaa --format report --split page --out audits/pages`: one dossier per page —
  identity, its screenshot, its rate, EVERY criterion of the standard with its status on that
  page, then each non-conformity as the ordinary auditor block. Nothing is re-decided (the
  same projection as the grid) and no format is invented (the same auditor block as the
  report), so a page sheet and the compliance report cannot disagree. `check` gates it against
  invented criteria like any other report; read **`references/pages.md`**.
- **"Which pages should I even audit?"** → `pages discover --crawl http://localhost:3000
  --write` (or `--sitemap <url>`) writes the `sample.pages` block for you, taking each page's
  name from its served `<title>` and NEVER overwriting the auth/storageState/notes already
  declared. Then `sample check` lints the coverage and `scan --sample` scans and snapshots it.
  A client-rendered SPA exposes no routes in its served HTML — use a sitemap there; read
  **`references/dynamic.md`**.
- **"Audit these URLs page by page, in CI"** → the shipped Action takes `urls`, `sitemap`,
  `crawl` or `sample`, snapshots every page it visits and writes every criterion's status under
  every page both in the job summary and in `audits/pages-status.md`. Use
  `pages-report: compact` for that status-only package: the Markdown, page JSON, source audit
  and verdict ledger only (no adjudication worklists, remediation report, HTML or crops),
  or keep the default `true` for the detailed page dossiers too. Request a `pages`/`full` PR
  comment when the same grid is wanted on the pull request; read
  **`references/ci.md`**.
- **"Nobody is here to rule on the judgment criteria"** → `judge --in audits/audit-latest.json
  --standard rgaa [--apply]` adjudicates them with a model, for a run with no coding agent in
  the loop (CI, the extension, an E2E run). It is a CALLER, not a second judge: same worklist,
  same evidence, same prompt, and the verdicts pass the same fail-closed gate yours do. Use
  `--runner api` with an API key, or `--runner claude|codex` with that local CLI's existing
  subscription login (`--runner cli` still aliases Claude). Inside an agent, prefer
  `verify --manual` and rule the worklist yourself; read **`references/judgment.md`**.
- **"Show the findings ON the pull request, not just a red job"** → `--format sarif` (upload
  to code scanning → inline annotations at the right file:line) or `--format github`
  (`::error::` workflow commands + a `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` table) — from `report
  --standard rgaa` when you want the pack's criteria rather than WCAG's; read
  **`references/ci.md`**.
- **"Make this code accessible / review it"** → audit the snippet
  (`audit - < component.html`) native-first; read **`references/authoring.md`** and
  **`references/forbidden-patterns.md`**.
- **"What does criterion X mean"** → `criteria` (e.g. `criteria 1.4.3`, or
  `criteria --standard rgaa 8.3`); see **`references/criteria.md`**.
- **"How trustworthy is a given check / what does the engine NOT catch"** → the engine is
  scored against the **W3C ACT-Rules test corpus** (~1 100 third-party examples): which
  checks are consistent, where recall is partial, which deviations are deliberate, and
  which statically-decidable rules are still missing — read **`references/act.md`**. Use it
  to calibrate how much of a criterion the engine really settles before you adjudicate.
- **"Country standard (RGAA, Section 508, EN 301 549)"** → `--standard <pack>` on
  `report`/`prd`/`criteria`/`check`/`verify`; see **`references/standards.md`** and
  **`references/methodology.md`**. **For a country-standard audit, PROPOSE the scan by
  default**: such an audit is normatively defined over a declared page **sample**, and an
  un-scanned `--standard rgaa` report is marked **partial** — say so rather than implying
  full coverage. The sample workflow (`sample check`, `scan --sample`, `--merge`) is in
  **`references/audit.md`**.
- **"High-assurance audit"** → `verify --report … --semantic`; see **`references/verify.md`**.
- **"Check contrast / rendering (dynamic tier)"** → `scan <url> --merge …` runs axe-core in a
  headless browser and, on the local runtime, probes focus visibility, 200% zoom, text
  spacing and content-on-hover, with bounded stateful interactions and authenticated pages;
  read **`references/dynamic.md`**.
- **"Close the criteria that came back `needs-rendered-dom`"** → they did not need a better
  model, they needed a browser. `scan` persists WHAT IT MEASURED beside each snapshot
  (`probes.json`, `axe.json`), so a page it zoomed, reflowed and tabbed through can come back
  **conforming** rather than « à évaluer » — RGAA 3.2/3.3/10.4/10.11/10.12 close on the
  measurement, and 10.1/12.8 become adjudicable from the real DOM. `verify --manual` warns
  before you spend a pass, `check --require-rendered` refuses, and the crawl is **unbounded by
  default** (`--max 0` / `--depth 0`), announcing every page it reaches. Read
  **`references/dynamic.md`** and **`references/pages.md`**.

## Orchestration — route by harness

The judgment phases fan out: `ADJUDICATE.todo.json` (one item per residual criterion) and
`VERIFY.todo.json` (one entry per NC claim) are independent per-item worklists, and
`orchestrate --run <dir>` emits a launchable workflow, per-role dispatch contracts and a
sequential RUNBOOK from whichever worklists currently exist. Fan-out is an optimization,
never a requirement: the gates are harness-independent, every phase has a sequential
fallback with identical artifacts, and the fail-closed `verify --apply` fold always stays
with you. Read **`references/orchestration.md`** for the routing table and the rules.

**`--standard rgaa` goes on `audit` too, and then everything speaks RGAA.** It is honoured by
`audit`/`scan`/`fix` as well as `report`/`prd`/`tickets`/`criteria`/`check`/`verify`/`judge`,
and `.ultra11yrc.json { "standard": "rgaa" }` makes it the default for all of them. Under it,
`audit` prints an RGAA-titled summary tabulated by thématique with findings tagged `[8.4]`
rather than `[3.1.1]`, in the pack's own language; `--json` and `--out` write a pack-keyed
document (106 criteria, 13 themes) carrying the WCAG core inside `core` for the pipeline; and
CI annotations, SARIF, the report, the PRD and the per-page sheets name RGAA criteria and
nothing else — no WCAG cross-reference anywhere in a pack deliverable. The engine still keys
on success criteria internally, because a pack criterion is DEFINED as a projection of them;
that is plumbing, and no reader sees it. Add `--pack ./pack.json` to load a standard at
runtime, and `--json` anywhere for machine output.
`--lang` follows the conversation (pass it explicitly — Core rule 7).

## The loop: audit → render → judge → fix → re-audit

To converge on conformance (not a single pass), chain the steps, letting the agent
drive the judgment and content stages:

1. **Audit** the source (`audit … --graph`) for a first map; on library-rendered code,
   **audit the render** (`render` → build/SSR → `audit`) for reliable verdicts (otherwise
   the scope-risk note reminds you).
1b. **RENDER BEFORE YOU ADJUDICATE — this step is not optional when a rendering criterion is
   open.** `scan <url|file> --runtime local --merge audits/audit-latest.json --out audits`
   (or `scan --sample`) drives a real browser, persists each page to `.ultra11y/pages/<id>/`
   **with what it measured** (`probes.json`, `axe.json`), and folds it in. Skipping it does not
   leave those criteria merely open — it makes them *undecidable by anyone*: no reading of the
   source settles computed contrast, 200 % zoom, 320 px reflow or text spacing, so every
   adjudication pass over them costs a model and returns `needs-rendered-dom`. Measured on one
   RGAA run over a two-file fixture: **80 criteria to adjudicate from source alone, 41 once a
   single page was scanned** — and of the seven a three-pass, $24.90 cascade was left holding,
   six closed on the measurement. `verify --manual` now says so before you spend anything, and
   `check --in <audit.json> --require-rendered` makes it a gate.
2. **Adjudicate & refute** with `verify`, two worklists. (a) `verify --manual --in audit.json`
   emits `ADJUDICATE.todo.json` — one item per residual *judgment* criterion, pre-loaded with the
   engine's harvested evidence — which the AI agent rules on (`C`/`NC`/`NA`, or `manual` with a
   `reason` when it truly `needs-rendered-dom`), each verdict carrying a `justification` or a
   groundable finding; `verify --apply … --in audit.json` folds them back FAIL-CLOSED (agent NCs
   become real `agent:<sc>` findings that re-render in §2). (b) `verify --report … [--semantic]`
   builds `VERIFY.todo.json`, which attacks **both directions**. It refutes any
   `preliminary`/SFC/library-source **non-conformity** the rendered DOM disproves, and — when a
   verdict ledger exists, which is the default — it also puts the ledger's agent-adjudicated
   **conformities** on trial, one item per citation, question inverted: *does this evidence
   establish the criterion, or only show that its subject exists?* Nothing used to challenge a
   `C`, so a criterion cleared because its subject was PRESENT rather than RIGHT shipped as a
   conformance claim. Same verdicts (`supported`/`partial`/`refuted`/`unsupported`);
   `verify --apply` drops the refuted/unsupported non-conformities and sends a refuted
   conformity's criterion back to « à évaluer » — never to NC, because refuting a conformity
   proves nothing against the criterion. `--no-conformities` opts out. This
   includes **focus & interaction logic** (read the full component source: keyboard
   operability, focus order/visibility, traps, on-focus/on-input changes; see
   `references/focus-and-logic.md`) and the per-rule traps in `references/false-positives.md`.
   Both worklists fan out (`orchestrate --run <dir> --phase adjudicate|verify-report` —
   see **Orchestration — route by harness**); the `--apply` fold always stays with you.
   **Rule each criterion against its OWN text, not your memory of it.** `verify --manual` also
   writes one small brief per criterion (`adjudicate/<criteriaId>.md`) carrying the criterion's
   official wording, its numbered tests and — under a country standard — that standard's own
   **test methodology** (RGAA publishes one for all 258 of its tests), plus its glossary terms,
   technical note and particular cases. Read that brief; under `--standard rgaa` it is RGAA
   that decides, never the WCAG success criterion behind it. Each brief also cites the
   criterion's official page: if a wording stays ambiguous and you have a web tool you may go
   read it — never to contradict the vendored text, and a web page is never an acceptable
   `normativeRef` (`--no-web` drops the offer; CI drops it by default).
3. **Fix** by priority: `fix --write --iterate` for the mechanical part (anti-regression
   gate), then hand-apply the judgment/content fixes (alt, labels, structure) guided by
   `references/correction.md`.
4. **Re-audit** (on the render where relevant) and repeat.
5. **Deliver the auditor block.** `report` (compliance doc: synthesis + one auditor
   conformance block — theme/criterion/test/WCAG+level/finding/expected/verification —
   per NC criterion) and `prd` (the same blocks as an actionable backlog; `tickets`
   filing one GitHub issue per criterion with that identical block) are two views of the
   ONE building block, in the language of this conversation (pass `--lang` explicitly —
   Core rule 7).

6. **Hand the change over to `review-a11y`, in a subagent.** Once the deliverable is out,
   the code you just fixed still has to be reviewed as a *change*, and that is the other
   skill's job — see **Handing over to `review-a11y`** below.

**Stop** when `check` and `verify --apply` are green again and only explicitly-named
residual risks remain. (To automate the outer cadence, the harness `/loop` command can
re-run this cycle.)

## Handing over to `review-a11y`

This skill does the analysis end to end: audit, render, adjudicate, fix, re-audit, deliver.
When it has produced fixes, **dispatch `review-a11y` on the code under change as a subagent**,
and report what it returns.

Use the host's native subagent capability: Codex dispatches a subagent with the prompt below;
Claude Code can use `Agent(...)`. If the host exposes neither, follow the sequential route below.

```
Use the review-a11y skill on the working diff. Return its report verbatim.
```

Two skills, two scopes, and the split is not cosmetic:

| | scope | asks |
|---|---|---|
| `ultra11y` (this one) | the repository, a page sample, a standard | *does this product conform, and where is the proof?* |
| `review-a11y` | exactly the code under change (staged, diff, or branch vs merge-base) | *is this change safe to merge?* |

**Why a subagent rather than an inline pass.** A full audit fills a context with a 3 MB
engine's output, dozens of reference files and a page sample; a review has to read the diff
closely with none of that in the way. Handing it over keeps the review's judgment
independent of the audit that just ran — the same reason `verify` refutes findings instead
of trusting them. If the harness has no subagent tool, invoke `review-a11y` directly: the
routing table in `references/orchestration.md` names the fallbacks, and the review is
identical either way.

**Do not paraphrase its verdict.** It returns a severity-ranked review with `file:line` and a
one-line verdict; that is the deliverable, not a summary of it.

## Combining engine, judgment and residual risk

`audit` classes each criterion `C`/`NC`/`NA` for the static subset and `manual` for the rest,
each carrying an `automatability` class that says WHY it is manual and how to close it:
**`static`** (the engine decides), **`needs-rendering`** (`scan`), **`judgment`** (you, from
the harvested evidence and the decision protocol). Engine `NC`s are confirmed candidates
with a cited `file:line`; a `preliminary: true` finding (SFC/library source) is provisional —
confirm it against the render or refute it. A criterion is never silently marked conforming:
the report is complete only when every applicable criterion is a justified `C`/`NC`/`NA` and
every residual risk is named. See **`references/methodology.md`**.

**Advisory recommendations are a distinct class.** A good-practice signal with NO failing
normative test renders under a dedicated section and can never flip a criterion to `NC` nor
enter `conformancePct`. An `NC` needs a `normativeRef`; a recommendation does not. Do not
promote one to the other — see **`references/false-positives.md`**.

## Do not

- Invent a non-conformity the engine did not find and you cannot see (contrast on
  **inline literal colours** is decided statically; **computed** contrast — external CSS,
  variables — goes through `scan` (Docker tier) or is verified at render before being declared).
- Add ARIA that duplicates native semantics.
- Mark a rendering/judgment criterion "conforming" without a recorded, gated justification
  (agent adjudication via `verify --manual`, or `scan` evidence).
- Hand-edit `references/criteria.md` (generated from the WCAG dataset via `criteria --generate`).

## Scope

Static engine: offline, deterministic, install-free; inputs are HTML + JSX/TSX (real AST,
cross-file analysis via `--graph`) + stdin. The **rendering** criteria (computed contrast,
reflow) are covered by the optional `scan` tier (axe-core, Docker **or** `--runtime local`).
The local runtime additionally **probes** focus visibility (2.4.7), 200% text zoom (1.4.4),
text spacing (1.4.12) and content-on-hover (1.4.13) — observed in the rendered page, raised
as NC only when the failure is seen (a clean probe leaves the SC `manual`, never silently
conforming); reading order and alt relevance are the AI agent's judgment, adjudicated from the
harvested evidence and gated (`verify --manual`).
